I want a complete MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) portfolio web app with a premium, modern, interactive UI. Build the project so it’s ready to run on Replit and for deployment (Vercel / Render / Heroku). Follow these exact requirements:

Design & UI

Use React (Vite or Create React App) for the client. Prefer Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for micro-interactions/animations. The design should be minimal, premium, and highly interactive (smooth entrance animations, hover effects, parallax hero, project cards with 3D-ish tilt).

Must be fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile) and accessible (semantic HTML, ARIA where necessary, keyboard navigation).

Provide a dark/light theme toggle with smooth transitions and color tokens.

Pages & components

Landing / Home: Hero with animated headline, short intro, CTA to projects / contact, values / stats section (animated counters), testimonial carousel.

Projects listing: filter by category/tech, search, sort by date or featured. Each card has hover animation and quick-view modal.

Project detail / case-study pages: large hero image, problem → approach → result sections, gallery, tech list, links (live / repo).

About: short bio, skills (visual bar or radial), timeline/experience, downloadable resume.

Contact: contact form (name, email, subject, message) that posts to the Express API. Perform server-side validation and send email via nodemailer or SendGrid, and save submissions to MongoDB.

Blog (optional but preferred): markdown-based posts stored in DB or simple CMS.

Admin Dashboard / CMS: protected by JWT and optional Google OAuth sign-in; admin can create/edit/delete projects, upload images (Cloudinary), view contact messages.

Back end & API

Node.js + Express API with REST endpoints for auth, projects, blog posts (if included), contact messages, file uploads (Cloudinary).

Use MongoDB Atlas (instructions & env var names included). Provide a local fallback if env vars missing for dev.

Authentication: JWT-based sessions + Google OAuth sign-in option. Admin-only routes require JWT + role check middleware.

Validation and sanitization (express-validator or Joi).

Uploads, assets & media

Integrate Cloudinary for image hosting with signed uploads from the admin (or server-side upload endpoint).

Serve optimized images. Provide lazy-loading and responsive srcset usage.

Developer experience

Monorepo-style structure: /client and /server with root-level scripts:

npm run dev → concurrently start client (React) and server (nodemon).

npm run build → build client.

npm run start → run production server that serves built React static files.

Provide a clear .env.example with required env var names and short descriptions.

Include a polished README.md with setup, environment variables, deployment steps (Vercel/Render), and common troubleshooting.

Quality, tests & CI

Add a sample unit test for React (Jest + React Testing Library) and one integration test for an Express route (supertest).

Add ESLint (Airbnb or recommended config) and Prettier config; include npm run lint script.

Add a sample GitHub Actions workflow (or Replit-ready CI) to run tests and lint on push.

Performance, SEO & analytics

Add meta tags for SEO (title, description, open graph), sitemap.xml generator, and robots.txt.

Include a placeholder for Google Analytics / Plausible and instructions to enable.

Use code-splitting and lazy load route-level components.

Polish & deliverables

Provide sample seed data for projects, an example admin user, and at least 3 sample projects with images.

Provide a complete file/folder tree at the root of the repo in the README.

Add clear Start instructions for Replit (what command to run) and "How to deploy" instructions for Vercel/Render.

Export all UI components as reusable, documented components with PropTypes or TypeScript types (TypeScript optional — prefer JS if time).

Aesthetic & UX notes

Modern typography (large hero fonts, comfortable line-height).

Use smooth scroll, subtle shadows, glassmorphism cards for premium feel, and micro-interactions with Framer Motion.

Keep colors neutral + one accent color; accessible contrast.

Build everything end-to-end (client + server + sample DB seeding) so I can run npm install and npm run dev in Replit and see a working portfolio with admin login and seeded projects. Provide the README.md, .env.example, and scripts exactly as described.
