# My Personal Portfolio

This repository holds the code for my personal developer portfolio. I created it to showcase my projects, skills, and journey as a developer.

The live version can be viewed here: ** will deploy later **.

## 🛠️ What's Under the Hood?

I chose a modern technology stack to build a fast, beautiful, and responsive website:

-   **Core:** React 19 & TypeScript, powered by Vite for a rapid development experience.
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI for a clean, component-based design system.
-   **Animations:** Framer Motion to bring the UI to life with smooth, fluid animations.
-   **Navigation:** Wouter for simple and efficient routing.
-   **Data Management:** TanStack Query for smart data fetching and caching.
-   **Forms:** A combination of React Hook Form and Zod for robust and type-safe forms.

## 🚀 How to Run It Locally

If you'd like to run the project on your own machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ByteOps02/My_Portfolio.git
    cd My_Portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install all the needed packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the local server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The site will be up and running at `http://localhost:5000`.
